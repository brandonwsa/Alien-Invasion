when shooting from right side of screen after multiple levels, got a division by zero error
	File "d:\Docs\Python\Alien Invasion\bullet.py", line 80, in _calc_bullet_velocity
    self.__x_velocity = x_diff / y_diff



FIXED-----------	First fleet is 1.0 speed, but second fleet wave is still 1.0 speed, this happens when starting the game up and playing for the
first time. 3rd fleet gets increased to 1.1 perfectly fine.
